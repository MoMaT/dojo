Python North East - Code Dojo: July 2014
----------------------------------------

The suggestions for this month's dojo problem were:

 - ???

 - Tournament ladder generator

 - [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock][rpsls] game

 - [Blackjack][blackjack] game

We chose to implement the Blackjack game.

Outcome
-------

We split into three teams and tried to implement the game mechanics
without any betting.

__TODO__: Please add your cod eto the repository.
