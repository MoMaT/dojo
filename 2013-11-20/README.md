Code produced at Python North East - Code Dojo
----------------------------------------------

Since we kicked off with Jamie Curle's excellent talk on Jenkins we
opted to be less than democratic and just picked an easy problem --
ascii art LCD-style display clock.


Problem: ascii art LCD-style clock 
----------------------------------

The idea was to produce an ascii art LCD-style clock that works in the
terminal. After a bit of debate we decided that each digit should be
represented as 3 columns and 3 rows of pipes, underscores and spaces.


Outcome
-----------
Each of the 3 teams managed to produce working applications (my team, team1
didn't get the clock bit working but had the display of the LCD
characters done). [You can view the 
code here] (https://github.com/pythonnortheast/dojo/tree/master/2013-11-20).

__TODO team 2 and 3 please upload your code!
