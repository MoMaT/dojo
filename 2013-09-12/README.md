# 2013-09-12: Conway's game of life  #

The aim of this month's dojo was to produce a bit of code that
implemented
[Conway's game of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). 

Two out of the three teams produced some working code and the third
team was very close. If you fancy finishing it fork it and off you go!
