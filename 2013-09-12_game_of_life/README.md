Python North East - Code Dojo: September 2013
---------------------------------------------

The aim of this month's dojo was to implement the generator for
[Conway's game of life][game].

Outcome
-------

Two out of the three teams produced some working code and the third
team (team 2) was very close. If you fancy finishing it, fork it and
off you go!
