Code produced at Python North East - Code Dojo: March 2014
------------------------------------------------------------


This month's dojo challenge was a follow on from the
[tutorial](https://github.com/pythonnortheast/slides/tree/master/2014/mar)
Rowan gave on [robot game](http://robotgame.net/). The idea was to
improve the AI for our bots and then pitch them in battle against each
other. 

The different versions of the bots that we created in the [tutorial](https://github.com/pythonnortheast/slides/tree/master/2014/mar)
part are in the [reference_bots](https://github.com/pythonnortheast/dojo/tree/master/2014-03-12_robot_game/reference_bots) directory.


Outcome
-------


Please add your bots to the [dojo_bots](https://github.com/pythonnortheast/dojo/tree/master/2014-03-12_robot_game/dojo_bots) directory, ensuring they are
uniquely named. 

We had one set of battles between two of the teams and unfortunately
we ran out of time after this (and were worried about being locked
in and were dogged with wifi issues!).
