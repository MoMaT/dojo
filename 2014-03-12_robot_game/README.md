Python North East - Code Dojo: March 2014
-----------------------------------------

This month's dojo challenge was a follow on from the [tutorial][tutorial]
Rowan gave on [robot game][robotgame]. The idea was to improve the AI for
our bots and then pitch them in battle against each other.

The different versions of the bots used in the [tutorial][tutorial]
are available the **reference_bots** directory.

Outcome
-------

We had one set of battles between two of the teams and unfortunately
we ran out of time after this (and were worried about being locked
in and were dogged with wifi issues!).

__TODO__: Please add your bots to the **dojo bots** directory
(ensuring they are uniquely named).
