dojo

Code produced at Python North East - Code Dojo: March 2014
------------------------------------------------------------

This month's dojo challenge was to improve the bots we made for
[robot game](http://robotgame.net/).


Outcome
-------

The different versions of the bots that we created in the [tutorial](https://github.com/pythonnortheast/slides/tree/master/2014/mar)
part are in the [reference_bots]() directory.

Please add your bots to the [dojo_bots]() directory, ensuring they are
uniquely named. 

We had one set of battles between two of the teams and unfortunately
we ran out of time after this (and were worried about being locked
in!).
