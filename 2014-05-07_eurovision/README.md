Python North East - Code Dojo: May 2014
---------------------------------------

Following Marc's talk on Django and JS we were inspired to create
REST-like service that allowed one to keep track of the votes during
the Eurovision Song contest. The scoring system is a little
complicated - have a look at [the descrition in Wikipedia][voting].

Outcome
-------

Some teams decided to implement the voting mechanism and generate a JSON
file with current state of the competition, other went as far as implementing
a real service in Django.
