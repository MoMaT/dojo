Code produced at Python North East - Code Dojo: January 2014
------------------------------------------------------------

Praveen gave a talk on greenlets and non-blocking I/O with gevent.

Then we voted on the following dojo problems:

- [Pig Latin][piglatin] translator (for Twelfth Night)
- sudoku solver
- maze generator
- minesweeper
- chess moves validator
- dice game (based on Settlers of Catan)

We chose to _try_ to create a maze generator.


Outcome
-------

We started with five teams but one of them split (artistic differences)
and we ended up with six final solutions.

The mazes we were able to generate were really different. Starting
from empty ones (ah, those display bugs), through partialy generated
(due to ambitious implementation ideas), not difficult (with easily
spottable solution) to quite challenging ones (at least at first
sight).

**TODO:**
Teams 1, 2, 3 and 6 please upload your code!
