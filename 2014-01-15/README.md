Code produced at Python North East - Code Dojo: January 2014
------------------------------------------------------------

The suggestions for this month's dojo problem were:

 - [Pig Latin][piglatin] translator to translate Twelfth Night;

 - Sudoko solver
 
 - Maze generator
 
 - Minesweeper
 
 - Chess validator


We chose to _try_ to create a maze generator. 

Outcome
-------

This month we had five teams. Everyone gave it a good attempt with
some different solutions implemented.
