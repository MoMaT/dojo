Code produced at Python North East - Code Dojo: January
-------------------------------------------------------

Praveen gave a talk on greenlets and non-blocking I/O with gevent...

We voted on the following dojo problems:

- [Pig Latin][piglatin] translator (for Twelfth Night)
- maze generator
- dice game (based on Settlers of Catan)


Outcome
-------

The mazes we were able to generate were really different. Starting 
from empty ones (ah, those display bugs), through partialy generated 
(due to ambitious implementation ideas), not difficult (with easily 
spottable solution) to quite challenging ones (at least at first 
sight).

**TODO:**
Teams 1-4,6 please upload your code!
