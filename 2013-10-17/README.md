# 2013-10-17: Countdown numbers game solver #

This month we continued the theme of implementing day-time TV games
and opted to try to code up a
[Countdown numbers game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)#Numbers_round)
solver.


Suggested dojo problems:

- a program to create an LCD number display in ascii characters;

- (and the opposite) a program to decode a number drawn in LCD style;

- naughts and crosses game;

- magic square solver;

- Countdown numbers game solver;

- maze generator;

- generate words from the set of hex digits;

- (and as ever Kieran's) text adventure game.
