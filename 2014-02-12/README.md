Code produced at Python North East - Code Dojo: February 2014
------------------------------------------------------------

This month's dojo problem was a follow up to the pygame tutorial.
The task was to modify the tutorial code of the game of Pong, to allow
single player play against an AI opponent.

Outcome
-------

As the tutorial itself was quite long, we just started playing around
with the initial ideas. Hopefully many people have been working on this
task at home and will submit their code for everyone to see here.
As a start, we have added a reference Pong code -- heavily commented
version of the tutorial code with a few improvements such as game over
and a simple AI (don't look if you are implementing your own).
