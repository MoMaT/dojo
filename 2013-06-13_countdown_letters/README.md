Python North East - Code Dojo: June 2013
----------------------------------------

Our first Code Dojo took place on Thurday 13th June 2013. We began by writing
a list of suggested coding tasks on the whiteboard, then voted on which one
we'd like to work on.

Suggestions
-----------
1. Text adventure game
2. Tic Tac Toe/ Noughts and Crosses
3. Countdown letters game
4. A maze
5. A Twitter/ web API
6. (Something else I can't remember now)

Topic
-----
After a quick vote, we decided to go with a Countdown letters game solver.
The task was to write an application which would allow the user to select
a random sequence of 9 consonants and vowels. The application could then
be used to provide the longest allowable word made up from the chosen letters.

Teams
-----
We split up into 4 teams of 2 or 3 to a team. The teams were chosen at random and
were made up of varying degrees of ability.

Outcome
-------
Each of the 4 teams managed to produce working code.
