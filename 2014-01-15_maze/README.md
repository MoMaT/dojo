Python North East - Code Dojo: January 2014
-------------------------------------------

The suggestions for this month's dojo problem were:

 - [Pig Latin][piglatin] translator to translate Twelfth Night;

 - Sudoko solver

 - Maze generator

 - Minesweeper

 - Chess validator

 - Dice game (based on Settlers of Catan)

We chose to _try_ to create a maze generator.


Outcome
-------

We started with five teams but one of them split (artistic differences)
and we ended up with six final solutions.

The mazes we were able to generate were really different. Starting
from empty ones (ah, those display bugs), through partialy generated
(due to ambitious implementation ideas), not difficult (with easily
spottable solution) to quite challenging ones (at least at first
sight).

**TODO:**
Teams 1, 2, 3 and 6 please upload your code!
