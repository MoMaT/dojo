# README - robot game part deux #

This is our second session at implementing bots for
[robot game](http://robotgame.net/home). We previously attempted this
in March 2014 - there's a
[tutorial](https://github.com/pythonnortheast/slides/tree/master/2014/mar)
and some
[example reference bots](https://github.com/pythonnortheast/dojo/tree/master/2014-03-12_robot_game/reference_bots)
and
[one](https://github.com/pythonnortheast/dojo/tree/master/2014-03-12_robot_game/dojo_bots)
produced at the dojo.
