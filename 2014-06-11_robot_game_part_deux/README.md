Python North East - Code Dojo: June 2014
----------------------------------------

This was our second session at implementing bots for [robot game][robotgame].
We previously attempted this in March 2014 - there's a [tutorial][tutorial],
some [reference bots][reference_bots] and [bots written at the dojo][dojo_bots].

Outcome
-------

We came up with several new ideas for the bots but did not inplement them
far enough to test the bots in a battle.
