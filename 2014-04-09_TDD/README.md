Python North East - Code Dojo: April 2014
-----------------------------------------

This month's dojo challenge was a follow on from the [talk][talk] Alex
gave about test driven development. The idea was to do a simple
problem but using test driven development. Alex suggested the
following problems:

 - write a module that allows transformation between cartesian and polar
   coordinate systems

 - write a module that counts frequencies of words passed to it
   (extra credit - remember previous counts and add to them)

 - implement a simple shopping cart (extra credit - add a discounting system)

 - implement a BankAccount class that can transfer money between
   accounts and has account limits

Setup instructions
------------------

  1. See https://github.com/ajkavanagh/PythonNE-TDD-Example

  2. Make a new virtualenv (if on a Mac/Linux. Not sure what you do on Windows!)
     This isn’t mandatory, but it is useful to have a fresh environment
     that doesn’t involve any other modules you’re working on.

  3. `pip install nose`

  4. For extra credit (http://falcao.it/sure/intro.html):
     `pip install sure`

  5. Have a browser page open at the following page for reference:
     https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html

  6. Create a simple project with: ./tests/init.py

Outcome
-------

__TODO__: please add your TDD code to the repository.
