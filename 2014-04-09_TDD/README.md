Code produced at Python North East - Code Dojo: April 2014
------------------------------------------------------------


This month's dojo challenge was a follow on from the
[talk](https://github.com/pythonnortheast/slides/tree/master/2014/apr)
Alex gave about test driven development. The idea was to do a simple
problem but using test driven development. Alex suggested the
following problems:

  1. Write a module that 'manages' Polar coords. Allow transformation
  between Cartesian and polar coords.
  2. Write a module that counts frequencies of words passed to
  it. Extra credit - remember previous counts and add to them.
  3. Implement a really simple shopping cart. Extra credit - add a
  discounting system.
  4. Implement a Bank Account class that can transfer money between
  accounts and has account limits. 

## Alex's instructions for set up:


  1. See https://github.com/ajkavanagh/PythonNE-TDD-Example
  
  2. For doing the dojo: Make a new virtualenv (if on a Mac/Linux. Not
sure what you do on Windows!) This isn’t mandatory, but it is useful
to have a fresh environment that doesn’t involve any other modules
you’re working on.

  3. `pip install nose`
  
  4. For extra credit (http://falcao.it/sure/intro.html): 
  `pip install sure` 
  
  5. Have a browser page open at the following page for reference:
(https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) 

  6. Create a simple project with: / tests/ init.py




##Outcome


Please add your group's TDD code to the [dojo](https://github.com/pythonnortheast/dojo/tree/master/2014-04-12_TDD) directory, ensuring they are
uniquely named.
