Code produced at Python North East - Code Dojo: December
--------------------------------------------------------

After Scott's ace talk on [Salt][salt] (the remote configuration
management system) we steeled ourselves for the code dojo.

Returning to the democratic process of choosing a dojo problem, our
suggested candidates were: 

    - [Pig Latin][piglatin] translator to translate Twelfth Night;
    
    - [Robot game][robotgame] - build an AI bot to control your army
      of robots to do battle with another army;
    
    - Ascii art Christmas tree;
    
    - Christmas themed text adventure game.
    
Finally, after Kieran suggesting the text adventure game every month,
it finally had it's day.



Outcome
-----------

Each of the 4 teams managed to produce working games, their were
varying degrees of narrative and complexity to the games.
