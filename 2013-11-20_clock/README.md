Python North East - Code Dojo: November 2013
--------------------------------------------

Since we kicked off with Jamie Curle's excellent talk on Jenkins we
opted to be less than democratic and just picked an easy problem --
ASCII art LCD-style display clock.

Problem
-------

The idea was to produce an ASCII art LCD-style clock that works in the
terminal. After a bit of debate we decided that each digit should be
represented as 3 columns and 3 rows of pipes, underscores and spaces.

Outcome
-------

Each of the 3 teams managed to produce working code. Team1 didn't get
the clock bit working but had the display of the LCD characters done).

**TODO:** team 3 please upload your code!
